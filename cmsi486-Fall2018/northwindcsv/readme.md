Some of the files that are in the download for the Northwind database are NOT in proper CSV format.

"Comma Separated Value" files [CSV] are supposed to have each field delimited with a comma.

If there are any commas that are embedded in the fields, they will cause the CSV parser to fail.
Things will get out of alignment and errors happen when loading them into databases.

You should use the files that are contained in this directory for your mongo and neo4j homework exercises.
