# cmsi486 - Introduction to Database Systems

This is the repository for CMIS486 for Fall semester 2018.

There will be some stuff put here, but most of it will be done to make it easy to find things, so students have a "one stop shop" to get resources for the class.

For example, I will upload copies of MongoDB, Neo4J, and other installation packages, and will provide instructions for installation and configuration.  I will also include links to the online resources such as user manuals.

For the relational database examples, students can use LMU Build, which supports both MySQL and PostGreSQL database engines.  There will be no need to post installation packages for those engines, since they are readily available for LMU students.  However, I might post these install packages here, in an effort to make things universally easy for students who want to experiment with their own installations of these fine products for experimentation purposes.
